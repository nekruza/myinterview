    question: "Does Fina work in my browser?",

      "Yes. Lessons, flashcards and the study plan work in any modern browser. For voice conversations, use Chrome or Edge, which can recognize speech, and allow microphone access when your browser asks.",

    question: "Is my voice recorded?",
    answer:
      "Fina doesn't save recordings of your voice. Your browser's speech recognition turns what you say into text, and that text is sent to our AI services so your tutor can reply. Audio for the live conversation is processed in real time and not stored. Before your first conversation you'll see exactly what is shared, and with whom.",

    answer:
      "Yes. It's the same Fina account, so your profile, words and progress are there when you sign in with the Google account or email you use on your phone. Sign in with Apple and Pro subscriptions bought through the app stores aren't available on the web yet.",

    question: "What do I get for free?",
